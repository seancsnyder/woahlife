I was a big fan of ohlife.com, but it'll be shutdown soon...
I'm building my own version of it, for my own usage, but feel free to clone it and use your own mailgun account.
Instead of supporting an entire site, I just want to setup come mailgun routes and a cron to send me email, as well as handle the signup of users. 


I chose to build something slightly more basic...
1) Install a lamp stack
2) clone this project into the directory root of a hosted site
3) run: composer install to get all of the dependencies up to date
4) configure a mailgun account, update config values in the file
5) setup the cron to email you everyday
